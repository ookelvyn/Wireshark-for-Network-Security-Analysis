# Analyzing HTTP Basic Authentication

In this project, we will analyze traffic on HTTP authentication using Wireshark. Wireshark has the capability of revealing credentials entered on an insecure website. The website to be used in this project uses the GET method for authentication.

Website: [http://httpbin.org/basic-auth/username/password](http://httpbin.org/basic-auth/username/password)

### Correct credentials:
- Username: username
- Password: 1234
